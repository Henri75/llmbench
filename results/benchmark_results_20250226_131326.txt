Pass Details:
Pass 1 Output:
```
The old mansion had been abandoned for decades, its grandeur and beauty slowly being consumed by the passing of time. The once-lush gardens were overgrown with weeds, the sound of crickets and the rustling of leaves the only signs of life.

A young woman, Emily, had always been drawn to the mansion's mysterious past. She had heard the stories of the family that had lived there, of the lavish parties and the secret trysts. But it was the legend of the ghost that had captured her imagination.

According to the local legend, a young girl had died in the mansion, and her spirit had never been allowed to rest. Emily had always been skeptical, but as she stepped inside the mansion, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched.

She began to explore the dusty rooms and cobwebbed corridors, her heart pounding in her chest. Every step creaked, every door groaned, and she couldn't help but wonder if she was truly alone. As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the room, Emily felt a chill run down her spine. She knew she had to leave, but as she turned to go, she heard a faint whisper in her ear: "Get out while you still can."
